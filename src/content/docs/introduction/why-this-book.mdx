There is no doubt we have all done Release Management before. We are all Release Managers. But that doesn't mean we've done it with consistency.

This book offers a way to consistently do Release Management. It is not the only way by any means.

At the time of writing, [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) is one of the world's largest providers of Work Management solutions. They have their own idea about what Release Management is and how to do it.

At the same time, they have competitors like [Monday](https://monday.com/) which have their own opinion. Some companies use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to manage their releases. Others make use of plain Markdown files (via editors like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)). Or they use free tools built into their Version Control like [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects).

Comparing these tools is like comparing different brushes for a painter. There are soft brushes, hard brushes, synthetic and natural brushes, long and short brushes, ... These all serve their purpose and -in capable hands- each of these may help render a masterpiece.

The problem is that these companies are manufacturing their own brushes. And whatever information about painting they provide, they do so with the intention of getting you to buy their brushes: "Squirrel brushes are great for watercolor, and we have just the right ones in stock right now!". While the information can be extrapolated to other tools, it is tainted with intentions of making profit.

This book is the opposite: it is aimed to be free, accessible and unbiased. You can do Release Management using plain post-its for sure. In fact, I think for some teams this might actually be a good remedy against being overloaded by the learning curves of other tools.

You'll learn:

- What makes up Release Management
- When to release and how frequently
- Who should be involved with a release
- Where to deploy the release
- How to structure a release
- How to revert a failed release
- How to gather feedback and improve future releases
- And how to be a better, kinder release manager

Ready? Buckle up - because here we go! ðŸš€
