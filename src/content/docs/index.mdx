## About

This is an online documentation resource about the Release Management process. It condenses all my knowledge about Release Management into an easy-to-read format.

I've been working a Front-End Engineer since 2015. I've worked for several startups and scale-ups. During this time, proper Release Management has made it possible to keep stakeholders aligned and all our users happy.

It is my wish that this knowledge may be public and open-source, so it may benefit people worldwide.
