## About

This book aims to offer a practical guide to Release Management, sharing insights and experiences I've gathered in this field, structured in an accessible and reader-friendly format.

Since 2015, I have been working as a Front-End Engineer, collaborating with various startups and scale-ups. Throughout my career, effective Release Management has been crucial in maintaining alignment with stakeholders and ensuring the satisfaction of our users.

I am committed to making this knowledge publicly accessible and open-source, with the hope that it will benefit people globally.
